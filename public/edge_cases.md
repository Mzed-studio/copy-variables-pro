# Edge Cases for Figma Plugin Implementation

## 1. User Authentication Issues
- **Scenario:** The user is not logged into Figma when trying to copy or paste collections.
- **Potential Issue:** The plugin should handle this gracefully and inform the user that they need to log in.
- **Current Handling:** The plugin checks for `figma.currentUser` but may not provide clear instructions on how to log in.

## 2. Empty Collections
- **Scenario:** The user attempts to copy a collection that is empty or does not exist.
- **Potential Issue:** The plugin should notify the user that the selected collection is empty or invalid.
- **Current Handling:** The plugin sends a message if no collections are found, but it may not specify which collection is empty.

## 3. Variable Aliases
- **Scenario:** Variables that are aliases may not resolve correctly when pasted into a new collection.
- **Potential Issue:** If the alias points to a variable that does not exist in the new context, it may lead to errors or unexpected behavior.
- **Current Handling:** The plugin attempts to create variable aliases but does not handle cases where the aliased variable is missing.

## 4. Mode Limitations
- **Scenario:** The user tries to paste a collection that contains multiple modes into a context that only supports a single mode.
- **Potential Issue:** The plugin should inform the user that the paste operation cannot be completed due to mode restrictions.
- **Current Handling:** There is a catch for a specific error message, but it may not cover all cases of mode limitations.

## 5. Storage Limitations
- **Scenario:** The user attempts to save a collection that exceeds storage limits imposed by Figma.
- **Potential Issue:** The plugin should handle storage errors and notify the user appropriately.
- **Current Handling:** There is no explicit error handling for storage limitations.

## 6. Network Issues
- **Scenario:** The user experiences network issues while trying to save or retrieve collections.
- **Potential Issue:** The plugin should handle network errors gracefully and inform the user.
- **Current Handling:** There is no handling for network-related errors.

## 7. Concurrent Modifications
- **Scenario:** The user modifies a collection in Figma while the plugin is trying to copy or paste.
- **Potential Issue:** This could lead to inconsistencies or errors in the copied/pasted data.
- **Current Handling:** The plugin does not check for concurrent modifications.

## 8. Unsupported Variable Types
- **Scenario:** The user attempts to copy a collection that contains variable types not supported by the target context.
- **Potential Issue:** The plugin should validate variable types before copying and notify the user of unsupported types.
- **Current Handling:** There is no validation for variable types before copying.

## 9. User Interface Feedback
- **Scenario:** The user performs actions that take time (e.g., copying large collections).
- **Potential Issue:** The plugin should provide loading indicators or feedback to the user during long operations.
- **Current Handling:** There is limited feedback during operations, which may lead to confusion.

## 10. Error Handling
- **Scenario:** Unexpected errors occur during any operation (e.g., API failures).
- **Potential Issue:** The plugin should catch and handle unexpected errors gracefully, providing user-friendly messages.
- **Current Handling:** There is minimal error handling for unexpected scenarios.
